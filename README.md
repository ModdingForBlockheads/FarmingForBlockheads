## Contributing

If you're interested in contributing to the mod, you can check
out [issues labelled as "help wanted"](https://github.com/TwelveIterationMods/FarmingForBlockheads/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
. These should be ready to be implemented as they are.

## Custom Market Entries

Data packs are now used to configure the market. You can place JSON files inside a `farmingforblockheads_compat`
folder (so the resulting path would be `data/<namespace>/farmingforblockheads_compat/{files}.json`) within a datapack which
will be loaded. For simple scenarios, you can also use the `MarketRegistry.json` file
under `config/farmingforblockheads/MarketRegistry.json`.

## Java API

If the IMC API is not enough for you, you can build against Farming for Blockheads' Java API.
The Java API allows everything the IMC API does, and certain tasks can only be achieved via the Java API.
However, if you don't need that extra control, it is recommended to use the IMC API.
